# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock

This is a simple one screen app to recreate the Big Bang Theory game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock".
It is based on the #100DaysOfSwiftUI guide from Paul Hudson.
The game is a re-version of the game "Rock Paper Scissors" with more complexities such as the addition of Lizard and Spock to it.
